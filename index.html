              <br>

              <p>Due to membership attendance and limited UMC pastors in the area, Seiter
                travels between Stewart
                United
                Methodist and Canaanville United Methodist each Sunday to ensure both churches have a service</p>

                        <p>Judy Morgan, treasurer of Stewart United Methodist, said the church's budget will be in a
                          $2,500 deficit this year due to a lack of members attending and donating. Any small drop in
                          their attendance could impact the church's funds, Morgan said. <br>

                          Membership loss has become a commonality among rural churches in Appalachia. A decrease in
                          funding has left churches in an unsettling state, depicting a crisis that may one day cause
                          them to close their doors for good.<br>

                          A recent Pew Research study revealed that 38% of adults in Ohio report going to church at
                          least once a week.<br>

                          Seiter said he saw the impact of low attendance rates. He previously worked as a pastor for
                          Pisgah United Methodist Church in Athens before the parish shut down due to low attendance.
                          Those members were forced to find other churches to attend.<br>

                          "(The church) got down to four people … they were getting to a point where they were not able
                          to pay their bills," Seiter said. "So they felt the need to close."<br>

                  <p>Low attendance numbers and a lack of funding were the
                    reasons many Southeastern Ohio churches closed their doors to the public. For St. Mary of the Hills
                    Church in Buchtel, 17645 Bank St., its community saw a lasting impact when its membership
                    diminished.<br><br>

                    On June 26, 2022, Rev. Father Mark Moore held the church's last mass. The church closed its doors
                    for
                    good on June 30.<br><br>

                    Father Moore began his work at the church after its former resident priest, Henry Christopher
                    Foxhoven,
                    sexually abused an underage parishioner at Holy Cross in Glouster while also serving at St. Mary of
                    the
                    Hill. Foxhoven was later found guilty of sexual battery and sent to prison for 12 years, according
                    to
                    the Zanesville Time Recorder.<br><br>

                    The church was left without a leader, so Moore was sent to serve the parish. However, it wasn't
                    enough
                    to keep the church open.</p>

                  <br>
                  <h2 class="" style="font-family: Merriweather ;"><i>"The parish was dying," Moore said. "There were
                      very few younger members."</i></h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Moore was worried the parish's diminished attendance would impact the charitable and Evangelical
                    outreach in Buchtel. Parishioners were losing their identity and a place to worship their faith, he
                    said. <br><br>

                    "We don't have the resources that an urban or suburban parish would have," Moore said. "So
                    financially,
                    it's sometimes a struggle for some parishes to exist."
                    <br><br>
                    Moore and the Diocese of Steubenville took three years to close the parish. During that time, they
                    searched for another use for the building as a possible mission church. As of December, the church
                    remains empty. <br><br>

                    On Oct. 14, 2022, Bishop Jeffery Montforton announced a plan to merge the Diocese of Steubenville
                    back
                    into the Diocese of Columbus. The Diocese of Steubenville was originally created in 1944 out of the
                    Columbus area. The change was due to a lack of priests available for services, economic pressures
                    and
                    demographic shifts in the area, according to The Steubenville Register.

                          In the past, religion held great significance for the residents of New Straitsville. However,
                          that has altered over time. Cheryl Stickdorn has lived in New Straitsville most of her life
                          and is an active member and a Sunday school teacher at the United Pentecostal Church. She said
                          there was a heavy religious presence in the town for the majority of the 20th century.

                          Despite the construction of a new church building in the early 2000s, the number of members
                          has continued to decrease.
                          <br><br>
                          New Straitsville was once a bustling coal mining town that saw its peak of production in 1918
                          and again in the 1960s. When the coal industry lost its foothold as a major source of fuel,
                          Southeast Ohio towns such as New Straitsville faced hardships. Businesses closed, and
                          residents moved out of the area. The 2020 census revealed the population in New Straitsville
                          village is 652, compared to its population of 2,208 in 1920.
                          <br><br>
                          On March 23, 1924, 90 people attended service with an offering of $2.59, equivalent to $44.33
                          in 2022, according to the Ohio Apostolic News. On Dec. 4, 2022, the church saw an attendance
                          number of 35 people and an offering of $83, Stickdorn said.

                  Students at Ohio University often find it difficult to find a place to practice their faith with
                  fellow
                  students in Athens.<br><br>
                  Madeline Daley, a sophomore studying media arts production, is a part of OU Catholics. Her choice to
                  continue practicing her faith in college has led her to partake in religious student organizations on
                  and off campus.<br><br>
                  "I just saw a lot of relativism in the world," Daley said. "Just the ability to ask questions … made
                  it
                  so that the truth was able to be communicated, and I could see that there isn't relativism with the
                  Catholic Church."<br><br>
                  Her religion inspired her to connect with like-minded individuals on campus with OU Catholics. Though
                  many college students may shy away from religious organizations on campus, Daley said she remains
                  optimistic about students' future.<br><br>
                  "I see hope for students actually seeing that Catholicism is alive and current, and not an archaic
                  belief," Daley said. "It can actually help with all aspects of someone's life."<br>

                        <p>The Pew Research Center recently estimated that by 2070, the
                          number
                          of Americans who identify as Christian would fall near or below 50% of the population, and

                          percentage could fall as low as 34%. Those identifying as "none" have been estimated to rise

                          as

                          Amid cultural change, churches in Appalachia are reviewing their practices and considering
                          reasons
                          for declining attendance. As closures trickle down, regular attendees like Stickdorn look back
                          to
                          the last century and acknowledge how the evolution of religious practices has changed the way
