                      <h3 class="lead" style="font-family: roboto;">Judy Morgan, treasurer of Stewart United Methodist,
                        said the church's budget will
                        be
                        in a $2,500 deficit this year due to a lack of members attending and donating. Any small drop in
                        their attendance could impact the church's funds, Morgan said.  <br><br>

                        Membership loss has become a commonality among rural churches in Appalachia. A decrease in
                        funding
                        has left churches in an unsettling state, depicting a crisis that may one day cause them to
                        close
                        their doors for good.  <br><br>

                        A recent Pew Research study revealed that 38% of adults in Ohio report going to church at least
                        once a week.  <br><br>

                        Seiter said he saw the impact of low attendance rates. He previously worked as a pastor for
                        Pisgah
                        United Methodist Church in Athens before the parish shut down due to low attendance. Those
                        members
                        were forced to find other churches to attend.  <br><br>

                        "(The church) got down to four people … they were getting to a point where they were not able to
                        pay their bills," Seiter said. "So they felt the need to close."

                        The United Pentecostal Church, 333 Main St., in southern Perry County, is one of three remaining
                        churches within the city limits. The other two are the Methodist and Baptist churches in the
                        center of town.<br><br>

                        In the past, religion held great significance for the residents of New Straitsville. However,
                        that has altered over time. Cheryl Stickdorn has lived in New Straitsville most of her life and
                        is an active member and a Sunday school teacher at the United Pentecostal Church. She said there
                        was a heavy religious presence in the town for the majority of the 20th century.</h3> <br>

                      <h1 class="lead display-6" style="font-family: roboto;">
                        "They even had the Bibles open in the bars," Stickdorn said. </h1><br>


                      <h3 class="lead" style="font-family: roboto;">

                        Despite the construction of a new church building in the early 2000s, the number of members
                        has
                        continued to decrease.<br><br>

                        New Straitsville was once a bustling coal mining town that saw its peak of production in 1918
                        and again in the 1960s. When the coal industry lost its foothold as a major source of fuel,
                        Southeast Ohio towns such as New Straitsville faced hardships. Businesses closed, and
                        residents
                        moved out of the area. The 2020 census revealed the population in New Straitsville village is
                        652, compared to its population of 2,208 in 1920.<br><br>

                        On March 23, 1924, 90 people attended service with an offering of $2.59, equivalent to $44.33
                        in 2022, according to the Ohio Apostolic News. On Dec. 4, 2022, the church saw an attendance
                        number of 35 people and an offering of $83, Stickdorn said.

                Students at Ohio University often find it difficult to find a place to practice their faith with fellow
                students in Athens.<br><br>
                Madeline Daley, a sophomore studying media arts production, is a part of OU Catholics. Her choice to
                continue practicing her faith in college has led her to partake in religious student organizations on

                "I just saw a lot of relativism in the world," Daley said. "Just the ability to ask questions … made it
                so that the truth was able to be communicated, and I could see that there isn't relativism with the
                Catholic Church."<br><br>
                Her religion inspired her to connect with like-minded individuals on campus with OU Catholics. Though
                many college students may shy away from religious organizations on campus, Daley said she remains
                optimistic about students' future.<br><br>
                "I see hope for students actually seeing that Catholicism is alive and current, and not an archaic
                belief," Daley said. "It can actually help with all aspects of someone's life."<br><br>

                      <h4 style="font-family: roboto;">The Pew Research Center recently estimated that by 2070, the
                        number
                        of Americans who identify as Christian would fall near or below 50% of the population, and that
                        percentage could fall as low as 34%. Those identifying as "none" have been estimated to rise to
                        as
                        much as 52% of the U.S. population in 2070.

                        Amid cultural change, churches in Appalachia are reviewing their practices and considering
                        reasons
                        for declining attendance. As closures trickle down, regular attendees like Stickdorn look back
                        to
                        the last century and acknowledge how the evolution of religious practices has changed the way
                        churches operate today.
